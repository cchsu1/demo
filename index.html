      <h2>Maximizing The “Golden Second” </h2>
      <font size="2">
      <p>Website designers and developers with high-bandwidth Wi-Fi and fixed-line connections often used to take bandwidth for granted. Responsive Web design (RWD) limits the creative process by forcing the same content, navigation and business processes to be presented on every device, irrespective of its physical capabilities. Solutions to ensure that we can easily measure performance, monitor user behavior based on the characteristics of the device and optimize Web pages for low-bandwidth devices are required to maximize the golden second.</p>
      <p>Essential for mobile Web performance testing is a method to simulate real-world mobile bandwidth conditions. Many wireless routers that cost less than $100 support bandwidth limiting. This simply involves limiting the uplink and downlink bandwidth for LAN-side clients. If the router doesn’t support this capability out of the box, then DD-WRT, an open-source firmware upgrade, may be used to replace the default operating system on many popular routers to limit bandwidth. I use a Linksys E3000 router modified with DD-WRT. The procedure to upgrade the router is pretty simple, and full instructions are available on the DD-WRT website. Once DD-WRT is installed, go to the “QoS” (quality of service) menu, and enable bandwidth limiting. Then, set values for the uplink and downlink. I prefer 256 kbps for the downlink and 28 kbps for the uplink to simulate an average mobile bandwidth connection.</p>

      <h2>Better Logging</h2>
      <font size="2">
      <p>A global fast-food franchise wanted to create a mobile-optimized version of its big-screen website. Before creating the first iteration of the mobile-optimized website, it performed analysis to determine which options on the big-screen website were being accessed by users on small-screen devices. </p>
      <p>The main menu, special offers and the store finder were the most popular, and so a mobile-optimized website was created that focused on these areas. Work didn’t stop there. Continued analysis revealed that the store finder was the most popular option. The mobile home page was altered again to focus on the store finder. Continued monitoring will show how many visitors choose other options, and the website will be continually refined to ensure that the most popular outcomes are catered to in the simplest possible way.</p>
      <p>Continually monitoring the content that users view according to device characteristics (such as supported radios or physical screen size) will help you to identify the content and services that are more or less popular on mobile phones. Perhaps you will see no difference, but unless you measure it, there’s no way to know for sure.</p>

      <h3><font color="#3399CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Small Batteries</font></h3>
      <p><font color="#3399CC" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mobile phones use radios for all communication, and they have little batteries that need to be carefully managed in order to avoid running out of power. As a result, radios are shut down very quickly when not in use, increasing the perceived time that a Web page takes to appear. 2G and 3G radios could require up to two seconds to establish an operational HTTP connection. If we accept that users start to lose interest after three seconds, then a website has only one second to respond. Think of this as the “golden second.”</font></p>
